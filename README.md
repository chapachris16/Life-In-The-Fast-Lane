# Life-In-The-Fast-Lane

#### Premise: I have a deep love for cars and I wanted this project to shed a bit of light on that. Having a project being based on something I carry a love for will make it easier to pay more attention to detail, and will in turn allow me to produce a better end product.

User Story

As a user I want to:

- .Create a goal of staying alive by having the player catch gas cans to keep the car from running out of gas
- .Adjust the speed that obstacles come in over time to create a challenge element to the game
