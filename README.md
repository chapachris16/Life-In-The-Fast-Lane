# Life-In-The-Fast-Lane

Premise: I have a deep love for cars and I wanted this project to shed a bit of light on that. Having a project being based on something I carry a love for will make it easier to pay more attention to detail, and will in turn allow me to produce a better end product.

User Story
As a user I want to

. Create a goal of staying alive for an alotted time(win condition) and then the player can choose to keep going for a higher time or end the game

. Set obstacles such as tires, other cars, traffic cones, and maybe road spikes. If a player collides with these obstacles the loss condition is activated

. Adjust the speed that obstacles come in over time to create a challenege element to the game

. Have Player also get gas to keep going (if player loses all their gas then a loss condition will be triggered)

. Have the canvas background to simulate a moving road to imitate travel
